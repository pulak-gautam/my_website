Hi,
<br>

I am Pulak, a senior year undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I am daytime scholar majoring in Statistics and Data Science, and Economics; and, a nightime roboticist, embedded developer.
<br>

Why the dissonance in my major and passion? \
So, back in high school, I was totally into economics, and apparently, I rocked at it! I mean, who knew econometric modeling could be so cool, right? Fast forward to undergrad, and I found myself falling hard for computers â€“ like, really digging into the nitty-gritty of how they work. These days, you can pretty much always find me tinkering with tools and soaking up all I can about robotics and embedded stuff in my free time. \
Now, I've got this plan brewing. I'm gonna wrap up my education (finally!) and dive headfirst into what really gets me going: that sweet spot where statistics, robotics, and embedded development all meet. It's like the ultimate blend of everything I'm passionate about, and I am so ready to make it happen!
