            <p>Hi,
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Why the dissonance in my major and passion? <br>
So, back in high school, I was totally into economics, and apparently, I rocked at it! I mean, who knew econometric modeling could be so cool, right? Fast forward to undergrad, and I found myself falling hard for computers – like, really digging into the nitty-gritty of how they work. These days, you can pretty much always find me tinkering with tools and soaking up all I can about robotics and embedded stuff in my free time. <br>
Now, I&rsquo;ve got this plan brewing. I&rsquo;m gonna wrap up my education (finally!) and dive headfirst into what really gets me going: that sweet spot where statistics, robotics, and embedded development all meet. It&rsquo;s like the ultimate blend of everything I&rsquo;m passionate about, and I am so ready to make it happen!</p>
